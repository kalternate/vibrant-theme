# Vibrant Theme for VS Code

This is a simple theme extension that adds a theme that uses bright and vibrant colors which are easily distinguishable from each other. It is largely based on the [Buloco Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=uloco.theme-bluloco-dark) which itself is a fork of One Dark. I really made this for my own personal preferences, but feel free to try it out if you want. Keep in mind I haven't tested it with that many languages though.
